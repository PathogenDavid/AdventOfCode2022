This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) implemented in Rust.

I didn't actually participate during December 2022, but rather I used Advent of Code as a way to explore Rust since I decided to take learning it more seriously this year. In general I wanted to explore several different approaches to using Rust and using various crates, so the solutions might feel a little all over the place.

Day 12 is where I decided the challenge was becoming less about exploring Rust and my ability to use it and more about computer science stuff so that's where I stopped.
